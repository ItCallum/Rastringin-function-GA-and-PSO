# Rastringin-function-GA-and-PSO
 A Report I will be discussing how I modified a GA and PSO algorithm to find an optimal value for the Rastringin function.

In the report I will be disscussing both algorithms and how I tuned each of the parameter of the intial pramaters to help get a best overall fitness.

For GA I ran each combernation of pramater through 4 different builds of the engine
(the 4 combinations of Mutator or Gaussian Mutator and Uniform Crossover or Single Point
Crossover) 30 times to create an average.

For PSO I sweeped through a varity of values for each pramaters 30 time to get an average best fitness for each of them.
